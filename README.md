Triangle Area Finder Written in Java

This repository is associated with my YouTube video, "Create a Java GUI Application to Find the Area of a Triangle!"
Here's the link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWRdOPh5BFQ

In the video, I walk you through how to write a GUI program in Java that allows the user to entery three (x, y) coordinate points to find the resulting area when a triangle is drawn between those points. So, if the user enters (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), the area will be 0.5, for example.

Feel free to download and play around with the code files here...you'll need both the .java and .form files, which can be opened in Intellij IDEA.

To download the free version of Intellij IDEA go to the link here:  https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/

Enjoy!
